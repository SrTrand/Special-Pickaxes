# Special-Pickaxes

This is a plugin that adds 3 new pickaxes, that are Smelter's Pickaxe, Explosive Pickaxe, and Bountiful Pickaxe. The Smelter's Pickaxe should smelt ore's when you mine them, and should turn cobblestone into stone, netherrack to nether bricks, iron ore into iron ingots, gold ore, into gold ingot, etc. The Explosive Pickaxe should break a 3x3x3 area and give you every thing in that area , or a natural explosion. The Bountiful Pickaxe, when you see a ore/block the blocks around that ore you mine will be the exact same item as the ore. 

Use /spick [bpick | xpick | spick] to give yourself a pickaxe. 

bpick -> Bountiful Pickaxe
spick -> Smelter's Pickaxe
xpick -> Explosive Pickaxe
